CRAMS
======

Overview
---------
The Monash University-eResearch Centre developed Cloud Resource Allocation Management System (CRAMS) is for resource allocation, instantiation and to report resource utilisation across Research Data Storage,  High Performance Computing Platform (HPC) and Research Computing Cloud. CRAMS provides an effective self service mechanism for researchers and research facilities  to request cloud resources, monitor usage and manage own allocations.  CRAMS further enables faster processing of resource allocation requests and provisioning of resources to end users. CRAMS reporting will enable effective strategic decisions on resource planning across Monash Research Data Storage, High Performance Computing Platform and Research Computing Cloud to address research needs better.
